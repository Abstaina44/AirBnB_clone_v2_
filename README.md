This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a 
clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or 
console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create,
update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system
of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between 
sessions
